# Sample Next.js Blog

This is a sample blog built with Next.js and Markdown to demonstrate the use of Next.js for a simple blog. 

The blog is styled with SCSS and is using the `.jsx` extension naming convention for React components.

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
